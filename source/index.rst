Welcome to swolebro's CNC Plasma Build documentation!
=======================================================

In brief, this build is using:

* Hypertherm Powermax65
* Dell Optiplex 980 (from 2010)
    * DB-25/parallel port breakout board
    * LinuxCNC 2.7
* Wantai DQ542MA drivers
* Wantai 425 oz-in motors (57BYGH115-003B)
* A belt drive for X and Y, and leadscrew for Z.
* A table with a target cut area >= 32"x48" (one third of a sheet).

If the prototype build could get precision to within 1/16th, I'd be
happy, and if it could get within 1/32, I'd be estatic. This is my
first foray into CNC machining, so I'm flying by the seat of my
pants and recording things here as I go along.

I've got the electronics running in a mock set-up for now.
Photos, videos, files, etc. are forthcoming.
